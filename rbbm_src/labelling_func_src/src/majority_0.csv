691,Rajesh Bhat,2014-10-15T05:15:27,"My honest opinion. It's a very mediocre song. Nothing unique or special  about her music, lyrics or voice. Nothing memorable like Billie Jean or  Beat It. Before her millions of fans reply with hate comments, i know this  is a democracy and people are free to see what they want. But then don't I  have the right to express my opinion? Please don't reply with dumb comments  lie ""if you don't like it don't watch it"". I just came here to see what's  the buzz about(661 million views??) and didn't like what i saw. OK?Ôªø",0,2,1
